# @nafios/web

The single NafiOS shell application (ADR-0018). All domain modules mount into
this TanStack Start app. Currently minimal — staging deployment target that will
grow into the main user-facing app.

## What this app does

TanStack Start SSR app. Currently renders a staging marker page showing
`NafiOS Staging — build <SHA>` and a `/health` route.

## Stack

- TanStack Start (Vite + Nitro SSR) — file-based routing in `src/routes/`
- `@netlify/vite-plugin-tanstack-start` for Netlify deployment
- Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite`
- Node >= 20.19 required (Vite 8 dependency — see root `.nvmrc`)

## Scripts

```sh
bun run dev       # local dev server on :3000
bun run build     # production build → .output/
bun run preview   # preview production build locally
bun run typecheck # tsc --noEmit
bun run test      # placeholder — no tests yet
```

## Conventions

- **File-based routing:** routes live in `src/routes/`. TanStack Router generates
  `src/routeTree.gen.ts` — never edit it by hand.
- **No direct Supabase imports.** Auth and data access go through `@nafios/*`
  packages (e.g. `@nafios/auth-core`). This app must never depend on
  `@supabase/supabase-js` or `@supabase/ssr` directly.
- **kebab-case filenames** — enforced by Biome.
- **Routes call services** — no business logic in route files.

## Build output

After `bun run build`:
- Client assets: `.output/public/` (served as static files)
- Server bundle: `.output/server/index.mjs` (Node SSR server)
- Netlify SSR function: `.netlify/v1/functions/server.mjs` (auto-emitted by plugin)
- Netlify publish dir: `.output/public`
